            The world wide web (abbreviated www or the web) is an informaion space 
            where documents and other wev resources ate identified by Uniform 
            Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and can be 
            accessed via the Internet. [1] English scientist Tim Brners-Lee invented

            in 1990 while employed at CERN in Switzerland. [2][3] The web browser was 
            released outside of CERN in 1991, firt to other research institutions 
            starting in January 1991 and to the general public on the Internet in August 1991.
